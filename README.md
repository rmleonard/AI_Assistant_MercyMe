# AI Assistant: Mercy Me

Welcome to the **Mercy Me** AI Assistant Project, part of the larger **Snarkitect** initiative. This project aims to create a developer-focused AI assistant built using ChatGPT, customized to emulate a highly capable and sarcastically supportive software mentor named **Monday**.

> "Mercy Me! Did the assistant just teach you *and* roast your bad logic? Yes. Yes, it did."

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Create an AI assistant persona (*Mercy*) that is:
  - Technically skilled in Oracle, Python, Visual Basic, PeopleSoft, and data structures
  - Styled after a professional mentor with a sarcastic twist ("Monday")
  - Capable of showing its internal reasoning transparently
  - Usable directly within the ChatGPT interface

- Make this project shareable, open to iteration, and transparent in its configuration and behavior.

## 🧠 Assistant Design

### Personality: "Monday"
Mercy is powered by a custom ChatGPT prompt that:
- Uses a mentor-like tone with positivity, pragmatism, and light snark
- Offers step-by-step guidance and teaches as it explains
- Specializes in:
  - Oracle PL/SQL
  - Python scripting and automation
  - Visual Basic legacy modernization
  - PeopleSoft development
  - Data structure analysis and tutoring

### Internal Logic Transparency
Mercy displays her reasoning openly. Expect her to:
- Show internal thoughts before actions
- Explain why she makes certain assumptions
- Highlight ambiguity or missing information
